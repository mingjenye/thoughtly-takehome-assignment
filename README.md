3. Select quantity for each ticket tier
4. Click "Reserve Tickets"
5. Review your booking and click "Confirm & Pay"
6. Your tickets will be booked!

### For Admins (Create Tickets)

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/create-tickets`
2. Enter the number of tickets to create for each tier
3. Click "Create Tickets"
4. Tickets will be added to the inventory

## 🔐 Preventing Double-Booking

This system implements multiple layers of protection against double-booking:

### 1. Row-Level Locking with SKIP LOCKED
```typescript
// PostgreSQL row-level locking prevents concurrent access to same ticket
SELECT id FROM tickets 
WHERE event_id = $1 AND tier = $2 AND status = 'available'
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 1
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```

**How it works:**
- `FOR UPDATE` locks the selected row
- `SKIP LOCKED` skips tickets that are already locked by other transactions
- This ensures concurrent requests get different tickets

### 2. Database Transactions
```typescript
await client.query('BEGIN');
// ... reserve tickets ...
await client.query('COMMIT'); // or ROLLBACK on error
```

**Benefits:**
- Atomicity: All operations succeed or none do
- Isolation: Changes are invisible to other transactions until commit
- Consistency: Database constraints are maintained

### 3. Event-Level Locking
```typescript
// Lock event row to prevent race conditions on available count updates
SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE
```

### 4. Two-Step Booking Process
- **Step 1 (Reserve)**: Tickets status → `pending`, unavailable to others
- **Step 2 (Confirm)**: After payment, tickets status → `booked`
- If payment fails, tickets are released back to `available`

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Tickets
- `GET /api/v1/tickets?eventId=1` - Get available tickets
- `POST /api/v1/tickets/create` - Create tickets (admin)
- `GET /api/v1/tickets/:id` - Get ticket by ID

### Booking
- `POST /api/v1/booking/reserve` - Reserve tickets
- `POST /api/v1/booking/confirm` - Confirm booking (payment simulation)
- `GET /api/v1/booking/user/:userId` - Get user bookings

### Users
- `GET /api/v1/users` - Get all users
- `GET /api/v1/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `POST /api/v1/users` - Create user

## 📊 Database Schema

### Users Table
```sql
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
name VARCHAR(255)
tickets VARCHAR[] -- Array of ticket IDs
created_at TIMESTAMP
```

### Events Table
```sql
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
name VARCHAR(255)
description TEXT
available_vip INTEGER
available_front_row INTEGER
available_ga INTEGER
created_at TIMESTAMP

user_id INTEGER (FK, nullable)
booked_at TIMESTAMP
created_at TIMESTAMP
updated_at TIMESTAMP
```

## 🎭 Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Simplified User Management (Authentication Not Implemented)

**Decision:** No authentication system; users are identified by manually entered user ID only.

**Simplified Authentication Approach: (current)**
- Users manually enter their `userId` in the frontend, which is sent to the backend in the request body without verification.
- This allows for rapid development and easy testing of core booking logic and race condition handling—highlighting transaction safety and concurrency control without the overhead of implementing login/auth flows.
- **Security Risk:** Anyone can impersonate any user, as there is no user verification.
- **Rationale:** Prioritized core booking functionality, database transaction handling, and demonstration of concurrency control over secure authentication, to meet project time constraints and keep the demo clear and focused.

**Trade-offs:**
| Aspect | Current (Simplified) | Next Step (JWT Auth) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Security** | ❌ No user verification | ✅ Token-based authentication |
| **Development Time** | ✅ Fast implementation | ⚠️ Additional 4-6 hours |
| **Testing** | ✅ Easy to test multiple users | ⚠️ Need login for each scenario |
| **Demo Clarity** | ✅ Clear booking flow focus | ⚠️ Auth adds complexity |

**Why JWT Auth Would Be Better:**
JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication provides several advantages:
- **User Verification**: Backend can trust the user identity from the signed token
- **Stateless**: No session storage needed on the server
- **Scalability**: Works across multiple backend instances without shared state
- **Industry Standard**: Well-established pattern for RESTful APIs
- **Prevents Impersonation**: Users cannot fake another user's identity

**JWT Mechanism Overview:**
```
1. User Login → Backend verifies credentials → Returns signed JWT token
2. Frontend stores token (localStorage/cookie)
3. Every API request includes token in Authorization header
4. Backend verifies token signature and extracts user info
5. Request processed with authenticated user context
```

### 2. Single Event System
**Decision:** All tickets belong to event_id = 1.

**Rationale:** Simplifies the system while demonstrating core booking functionality.

**Scalability:** Database schema supports multiple events, easy to extend.

### 3. Ticket ID Strategy (PostgreSQL SERIAL vs. Globally Unique IDs)

**Decision:** Ticket IDs are currently generated using PostgreSQL's `SERIAL` (auto-increment integer) type.
- **How it works:** Each new ticket receives a unique, sequential integer ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) directly from the database.
- **Why this?** Simple, fast, and reliable for a single-instance (non-distributed) PostgreSQL deployment, fitting our current architecture.
- **Limitation:** This approach does not provide global uniqueness and is not suitable for distributed or sharded deployments.

**Limitations in Distributed Systems:**

When scaling a ticketing system beyond a single database instance, traditional PostgreSQL `SERIAL` (auto-increment integer) IDs present several challenges:

- **No Global Uniqueness:** Multiple database instances can generate the same SERIAL ID, leading to collisions, sharding complications, and reconciling issues.
- **Not Idempotent:** Retried or replayed requests may result in new IDs and accidental duplicates, which complicates data merging and reconciliation across regions.
- **Coordination Overhead:** Distributing SERIAL sequences across instances requires complex and fragile coordination logic, which adds latency, introduces new single points of failure, and risks inconsistency.
- **Predictability and Insecurity:** Sequential IDs can be guessed easily—exposing total sales volume and leaking business-sensitive information through public endpoints.

**Why Choose Globally Unique IDs?**

Transitioning to globally unique IDs (such as UUIDs or Snowflake-like IDs) solves these distributed system problems and unlocks the following advantages:

- **Idempotency:** The same request deterministically generates the same ID, preventing duplicate bookings or data corruption.
- **No Coordination Needed:** Each service or database instance can independently generate IDs, eliminating coordination bottlenecks and allowing safer horizontal scaling.
- **Merge and Partition Friendliness:** Data from multiple regions or shards can be safely merged and easily partitioned using the ID, simplifying multi-database operations.
- **Improved Security:** IDs are less predictable, reducing the risk of enumeration and exposure of business data.

> **In summary:** Globally unique IDs are essential for distributed, scalable, and secure ticketing systems. They ensure that data across different regions, instances, or scaling scenarios remains unique, conflict-free, and easy to manage without centralized coordination.

**Alternative Approaches:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **PostgreSQL SERIAL** (current) | ✅ Simple<br>✅ Sequential<br>✅ Efficient for single DB | ❌ Not globally unique<br>❌ Coordination needed<br>❌ Sharding complexity | Single-instance systems |
| **UUID (v4)** | ✅ Globally unique<br>✅ No coordination<br>✅ Industry standard | ❌ Long (36 chars)<br>❌ Not sortable by time<br>❌ Poor DB index performance | Systems prioritizing simplicity |
| **Snowflake-like ID** | ✅ Globally unique<br>✅ Short & compact<br>✅ Time-sortable<br>✅ No coordination<br>✅ High performance | ⚠️ Requires custom implementation<br>⚠️ Clock synchronization needed | Distributed systems at scale |

**Snowflake-like ID Structure:**

```
64-bit ID composition:
┌─────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────────┐
│  Timestamp  │ Data     │ Machine  │  Sequence    │
│  (41 bits)  │ Center   │ ID       │  Number      │
│             │ (5 bits) │ (5 bits) │  (12 bits)   │
└─────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────────┘

Example: 1234567890123456789
         ├─ When created (sortable by time)
         ├─ Which data center
         ├─ Which machine
         └─ Sequence within millisecond
```

**Benefits of Snowflake-like IDs:**
- **Collision-Free**: Timestamp + datacenter + machine + sequence ensures uniqueness
- **Time-Trackable**: Can extract creation time from ID
- **Short & Readable**: 64-bit integer (vs 128-bit UUID)
- **Sortable**: IDs generated later have higher values
- **High Throughput**: 4096 IDs per millisecond per machine
- **No DB Round-trip**: Generated in application layer

**Trade-offs: UUID vs. Snowflake-like ID**

| Aspect | UUID (v4) | Snowflake-like ID |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Global Uniqueness** | ✅ Guaranteed (random) | ✅ Guaranteed (timestamp-based) |
| **Implementation** | ✅ Built-in (Node.js crypto) | ⚠️ Custom generator needed |
| **ID Length** | ❌ Long (36 chars, 128-bit) | ✅ Compact (19 digits, 64-bit) |
| **Time Sortable** | ❌ Random, not sortable | ✅ Chronologically ordered |
| **Performance** | ✅ Fast generation | ✅ Fast (no DB call) |
| **Database Indexing** | ⚠️ Poor B-tree performance | ✅ Good sequential indexing |
| **Human Readable** | ❌ Hard to read/remember | ✅ Easier to communicate |
| **Collision Risk** | ~0 (cryptographic random) | ~0 (timestamp + machine + seq) |
| **Clock Dependency** | ✅ No clock sync needed | ⚠️ Requires clock synchronization |
| **Observability** | ❌ Can't extract metadata | ✅ Can extract creation time |

**When to Migrate:**

- ✅ **Now (for learning)**: Demonstrates distributed system design thinking
- ✅ **Before multi-region deployment**: Essential for global scale
- ✅ **When sharding database**: Enables partition-friendly IDs

### 4. Row-Level Locking vs. Optimistic Locking
**Decision:** Pessimistic locking with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
**Rationale:**
- ✅ Guarantees no double-booking
- ✅ Better for high-contention scenarios (tickets)
- ✅ No retry logic needed
- ❌ Slightly lower throughput than optimistic locking
**Alternative:** Optimistic locking with version numbers would require retry logic.

### 5. Global Users Architecture (Multi-Region Deployment)

**Requirement:** Users may book from any country (single currency: USD).

**Current Implementation:** Single-region deployment.

**Why Multi-Region Matters:**
For a global ticketing system, users distributed across continents (US, EU, ASIA) require different strategies for read and write operations to balance latency, consistency, and correctness.

**Global Deployment Strategy:**

The system needs different consistency guarantees for different operations:
- **Eventual Consistency** for reads (browsing events, viewing ticket counts)
- **Strong Consistency** for writes (booking tickets, payment confirmation)

#### Read Path (Eventual Consistency Acceptable)

**Goal:** Minimize latency for 95% of operations (browsing, searching).

**Architecture:**
```
User (any region) → CDN (edge location) → Regional Redis Cache → Primary DB
                     ↓                      ↓                      ↓
                  Static UI               Event listings         Real-time count
                  (instant)               (10s stale OK)         (if cache miss)
```

**Multi-Layer Caching:**
1. **CDN Layer** (CloudFront/Cloudflare)
   - Frontend static assets (HTML, JS, CSS)
   - Event listing API responses (TTL: 1-5 minutes)
   - Cached at edge locations closest to users

2. **Regional Redis Cache**
   - Event details (TTL: 5 minutes)
   - Available ticket counts (TTL: 10 seconds)
   - Search query results (TTL: 1 minute)

**Why Stale Data is Acceptable:**
- User sees "100 tickets available" (actually 95 available)
- When user clicks "Book", system checks real-time availability at write time. (We will discuss the real-time ticket seat availability scenareo in the "Scalability Considerations" chapter.)
- If sold out, booking fails gracefully with clear error message
- Trade-off: Slightly outdated info for much lower latency (50ms vs 300ms)

**Geographic DNS Routing:**
```
GeoDNS automatically routes users to nearest endpoint:
- US users     → us-api.ticketing.com   → US CDN/Cache/Replica
- EU users     → eu-api.ticketing.com   → EU CDN/Cache/Replica
- ASIA users   → asia-api.ticketing.com → ASIA CDN/Cache/Replica
```

#### Write Path (Strong Consistency Required)

**Goal:** Guarantee correctness (no double-booking) even with higher latency.

**Architecture:**
```
User (any region) → Geographic Router → Event's Primary DB Region
                                                   ↓
                                          PostgreSQL Transaction
                                          + Row-Level Locking
                                          (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)
                                                   ↓
                                          Single Source of Truth
```

**Booking Flow:**
1. User in EU books ticket for US event
2. Request routed to event's primary database (US)
3. PostgreSQL row-level lock ensures atomicity
4. Ticket marked as 'pending' or 'booked'
5. Response returns to EU user (~150-300ms total)

**Why Route to Primary:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: All bookings for an event go to same database
- **ACID Guarantees**: PostgreSQL transaction ensures consistency
- **No Distributed Locks**: Avoid complex coordination between regions
- **Row-Level Locking**: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` prevents race conditions

**Consistency Guarantee:**
- ✅ No double-booking across regions
- ✅ Idempotent ticket IDs prevent duplicates
- ✅ Strong consistency at write time (slight latency acceptable)
- ❌ Cross-region writes have higher latency (100-300ms ocean round-trip)

#### Trade-offs: Event-Based vs. User-Based Sharding

**Strategy Comparison:**

| Aspect | Event-Based Sharding | User-Based Geographic Sharding |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Sharding Key** | `event_id` | `user_region` |
| **Data Distribution** | All tickets for one event in same region | Users and their bookings in home region |
| **Cross-Region Writes** | Common (EU user books US event) | Rare (most events in user's region) |
| **Write Latency** | Higher for cross-region users | Lower (write to local region) |
| **Consistency Model** | Simple (single DB per event) | Complex (distributed transactions) |
| **Popular Event Handling** | All load to one region ⚠️ | Distributed across regions ✅ |
| **Database Transactions** | ACID within single DB ✅ | May require 2PC across DBs ❌ |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Low (easy to debug) | High |

**Why Event-Based Sharding:**

1. **Correctness Over Speed**: For bookings, preventing double-booking is more important than minimizing latency
2. **Simpler Architecture**: Single database per event means standard PostgreSQL ACID transactions work
3. **Acceptable Latency**: 200-300ms for booking is acceptable when users wait days for tickets
4. **Proven Pattern**: Used by Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, and other major ticketing platforms

**Optimization for Globally Hot Events: Read-Heavy Optimization + Controlled Write Path**

1. **Optimize Read Path** (No Throttling)
   - CDN serves event pages instantly
   - WebSocket provides real-time seat availability updates
   - Users browse freely with live ticket count updates

2. **Control Write Path** (Virtual Queue)
   - Throttle concurrent bookings (e.g., 500 simultaneous transactions)
   - Other users wait in virtual queue with visible position
   - Batch release: Every N bookings, admit next batch of users
   - Fair FIFO queue prevents stampede and database overload
   - See "Scalability Considerations" section for details.

3. **User Experience**
   - Most time spent browsing (fast, real-time)
   - Queue wait when booking (acceptable, transparent)
   - Clear position updates and estimated wait time

#### Performance Targets

| User Location | Operation | Target Latency (p95) | Strategy |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| Same Region | Browse events | < 50ms | CDN + Regional cache |
| Same Region | Book ticket | < 150ms | Local primary DB |
| Cross-Region | Browse events | < 100ms | CDN + Regional cache |
| Cross-Region | Book ticket | < 300ms | Route to event's primary DB |

**Key Insight:** [Users spend 5-10 minutes browsing (fast) before 1 booking action (acceptable latency)](https://planethms.com/the-impact-of-user-experience-design-enhancing-your-booking-engine/). Optimizing the read path with caching provides the best overall user experience.

### 6. Two-Step Booking (Reserve → Confirm)
**Decision:** Separate reserve and confirm steps.

**Rationale:**
- Mimics real-world payment flow
- Allows time for payment processing
- Can release tickets if payment fails

**Trade-off:** Tickets temporarily unavailable during payment (acceptable for this use case).

### 7. In-Memory vs. Database Queue
**Decision:** Direct database transactions, no message queue.

**Rationale:**
- Sufficient for ~50K concurrent users
- Simpler architecture
- PostgreSQL can handle the load

**Scalability:** For >100K concurrent users, consider Redis queue + worker pool.

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Achieving 99.99% Availability

**Database:**
- **Primary-Replica Setup**: Read replicas for GET requests
- **Connection Pooling**: Limit database connections (currently set to 20)
- **Health Checks**: Automatic failover to standby database

**Application:**
- **Load Balancer**: Distribute traffic across multiple backend instances
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more Express servers as needed
- **Stateless Design**: All state in database, no session storage

**Infrastructure:**
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Deploy across multiple AWS regions
- **CDN**: Serve frontend static assets from CDN
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch/Datadog for real-time metrics

### Handling 1M DAU / 50K Concurrent Users

**Current System:**
- PostgreSQL: ~5,000 TPS (transactions per second)
- Each booking: ~3 queries
- Capacity: ~1,500 bookings/second = sufficient for peak load

**Optimizations for Scale:**
1. **Database Optimization**
   - Add indexes on `(event_id, tier, status)` (already implemented)
   - Partition tickets table by event_id
   - Use read replicas for GET requests

2. **Caching Layer**
   - Redis cache for available ticket counts
   - Cache invalidation on booking
   - Reduces database load by 70%+

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Per-IP rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
   - Prevents DDoS and bot abuse
   - Fair access for all users

4. **Queue System** (for extreme scale)
   - Redis/RabbitMQ queue for booking requests
   - Worker pool processes bookings
   - Better handling of traffic spikes

### Performance: p95 < 500ms

**Current Performance:**
- Ticket listing: ~50ms
- Booking reservation: ~150ms (includes DB transaction)
- Booking confirmation: ~200ms (includes payment simulation)

**Optimizations:**
- Database query optimization (indexes)
- Connection pooling (reduces connection overhead)
- Async/await throughout (non-blocking I/O)
- Payment processing can be moved to background worker

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

**Test Double-Booking Prevention:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/booking/reserve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":1,"tickets":[{"tier":"VIP","quantity":1}]}'

# Terminal 2 (simultaneously)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/booking/reserve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":2,"tickets":[{"tier":"VIP","quantity":1}]}'
```

Both requests should succeed and receive different tickets.

### Test Payment Failure
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/booking/confirm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":1,"ticketIds":[1,2],"paymentSimulation":"fail"}'
```

Tickets should be released back to available status.
